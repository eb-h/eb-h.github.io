I was only free for the first few hours of the CTF so I only did the challenges that were available at the start. These were just some of the easier challenges...

We're given a file:
```
Filename: Hello
MD5 Hash: c18a01a95e1bb126e0322c97c8b865e3
Size: 1024 bytes
```

`file` doesn't recognise the filetype. Hexdumped the file and there were some python strings. Filesize + python strings + `file` implied to me that it was probably a `.pyc`. Googling the first eight bytes in the file confirms this. Running `uncompyle6` decompiles it back to the original python script which I've included below.

```python
def main(input):
    j = -4
    for c in input:
        if j == 1:
            if c != 'Z':
                exit(43)
            else:
                if j == -7:
                    if c != 'w':
                        exit(133)
                    else:
                        if j == -5:
                            if c != 'f':
                                exit(42069)
                            else:
                                if j == -4:
                                    if c != 'C':
                                        exit(11037)
                                else:
                                    if j == 7:
                                        if c != 'R':
                                            exit(9001)
                                        else:
                                            if j == -2:
                                                if c != 'F':
                                                    exit(11037)
                                            if j == -1 and c != '{':
                                                exit(11037)
                                    if j == 4 and c != '3':
                                        exit(11037)
                        elif j == 0 and c != '3':
                            exit(11037)
                else:
                    if j == -3:
                        if c != 'T':
                            exit(82)
                        if j == 2:
                            if c != '_':
                                exit(11037)
                        if j == -6:
                            if c != 't':
                                exit(133)
                        if j == 6:
                            if c != 'E':
                                exit(133)
                    elif j == 9 and c != '3':
                        exit(7223)
        else:
            if j == 3:
                if c != 'R':
                    exit(133)
                if j == 5:
                    if c != 'V':
                        exit(133)
                if j == 8:
                    if c != '5':
                        exit(6738)
            elif j == 10:
                if c != '}':
                    exit(1111)
            j += 1
    else:
        print('Hello World')
```

There's seemingly mistakes in it, such as
```python
                    if j == -3:
                        if c != 'T':
                            exit(82)
                        if j == 2:
                            if c != '_':
                                exit(11037)
```
The code would never check if `c != '_'` when `j == 2`, but it's probably intentional since not all values of `j` are checked either. 

I just built a dictionary of all values of `j` that are implied, and then print them out in order.

```python
d = {  # various expected values, for values of j
        1: 'Z',
        -7: 'w',
        -5: 'f',
        -4: 'C',
        7: 'R',
        -2: 'F',
        -1: '{',
        4: '3',
        0: '3',
        -3: 'T',
        2: '_',
        -6: 't',
        6: 'E',
        9: '3',
        3: 'R',
        5: 'V',
        8: '5',
        10: '}'
    }

if __name__ == '__main__':
    res = ''.join([d[i] for i in range(-7, 11)])
    print(res)
```

We're given a tiny C file
```c++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int water;
  char bottle[125];

  water = 0;
  printf("Fill the water bottle kid!");
  gets(bottle);

  if(water != 0) {
      system("cat gift.txt");
  } else {
      printf("You are crazy lazy!:)\n");
  }
}
```

*Filling a water bottle* sounds like filling a buffer. There's not much else there, so I just tried to give a buffer of size 126, and that didn't do it so I doubled the buffer size and then got the flag.

I saw a bunch of `esc` and `:g/foo/bar/`, and `ZZ` at the end. This was plenty to be pretty confident it was a bunch of VIM commands. At the end you get `d3RmQ1RGe1ZpbV9lRGl0MHJfaSRfNHdlUzBtRX0=`, just convert from base64.
